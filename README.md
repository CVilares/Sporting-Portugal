#Sporting portugal

##This website was created for the love of Sporting Portugal, a sports club in portugal. With this page we intend to create a daily meeting point for the fans of this club and as a future goal to be a space where you can find daily news,pre, mid and end seasons analyzes,players analyzes, a space where our visitors can check the list of trophies in different modalities and a forum to share opinions. So far we offer an updated list of the next games, all official social channels, a hall of fame, that will be our future virtual museum and a "join us" segment, where you can join our team building a free, non profit and passionate source of information about our sports club.
