### **Sign Up/Join us**

This is an HTML code for a webpage that displays information about Sporting Portugal, a football club in Lisbon, Portugal.

The webpage consists of a header, a form to join the team, and a footer. The header contains the name of the club, a logo, and a navigation bar with links to the home page, the hall of fame, and a signup page. The form allows users to input their first name, last name, email address, and a message. The footer contains the name of the website and links to the club's social media pages.

The webpage uses a CSS stylesheet to define the layout and style of the webpage, including the position and size of the elements, the fonts, colors, and background. It also uses Font Awesome, an external library that provides icons for the social media links.When the user hovers over the footer element, the "transform" property is applied, which moves the element upwards by 10 pixels using the "translateY" function. This creates a visually pleasing animation effect.
